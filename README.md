# fretboard-games
CLI-based game to help me memorise notes/scales on a fretboard

This is work in progress for 2025. 

The goal is to create a command-line game that helps me memorise the notes and scales on a guitar fretboard.
It should be able to help me answer questions like:
* What note is on the 5th fret of the 2nd string?
* What are the notes in a C major scale on the 6th string?
* What are the notes in a G major chord on the 1st string?
* List all C notes on the fretboard in strings 1-4.

This game should be configurable to allow for different tunings, number of strings.
A stretch goal is to support keeping track of how fast I answer questions and keep a high score.
